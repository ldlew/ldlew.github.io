I maintain an online DND group that has grown to 80+ members. Unfortunately, the foundational appeal of this group is that no one needs to manage their own character sheets---it is all up to the admin. With the current scale of the group, this is a gargantuan task, so I created this React App to better maintain, update, and distribute this information.

This React app uses Redux for state management, Axios for network requests, and a MongoDB/NOSQL database that is hosted on Atlas. At the moment, one can fill out a form to create a character and view all characters that are currently in the database.
